# Embedded-RHEM-Snow
This version of RHEM-Snow embeds the Python interpreter in the RHEM executable, which runs the Snow Python code within RHEM.  This allows the RHEM and Snow models to pass data directly between them, rather than writing/reading files.  The RHEM code, which is Fortran, is linked to a C library which uses the Python/C API to embed the interpreter and provide bridge functions between Fortran and Python.  The Fortran code calls a bridge function which converts the passed data to Python types and calls the corresponding Python function through the interpreter.  The bridge function converts the data returned from Python to C types and passes the data back to the Fortran code.  The Python code can be changed/updated without changing the Fortran or C code as long as the function calls are not altered.
